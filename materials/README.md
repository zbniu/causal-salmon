# Materials

- [app_prompt.txt](app_prompt.txt): current neutral v7 App prompt, including mandatory downloadable final report and submission archive.
- [uploads/](uploads/): each D01–D06 / F01–F18 folder contains exactly the two model inputs, `STUDY_DESCRIPTION.md` and `data.csv`. Final results use F01–F12 only. D01–D06 are retained development materials; the complete six-case model pilot was not completed, and earlier prompt checks are not formal results.
- [study_descriptions/](study_descriptions/): the six public world/semantic descriptions for research inspection.
- [scoring_prompt.md](scoring_prompt.md): current operator-side artifact review prompt. Never send it to tested models.
- [prompt.txt](prompt.txt), `named/`, `anonymized/`, and `substitutions.json`: byte-identical frozen offline baseline materials required by existing source checks. **Use app_prompt.txt for the reported App procedure**, not this older baseline prompt.

The [case index](../configs/case_index.csv) records original material order, data hashes and scope. It is not independent evidence of actual session chronology or prompt delivery. Never upload this index, world labels, hidden truth, grading rules or this whole repository to a tested model.
